🎁 Hadiaty – Smart Gift & Event Management App

Hadiaty is a modern Flutter application designed to simplify event planning and gift coordination.
It allows users to create events, share wish lists, and let friends and family pledge gifts — eliminating duplicate purchases and improving communication.

What This App Solves

When organizing birthdays, weddings, or special occasions, people often:

Receive duplicate gifts

Don’t know what the person really wants

Have no clear way to coordinate

Hadiaty fixes this by creating a social, real-time gift planning system.

All updates are instantly reflected for all users using Firestore.

Clean & Modern UI
Designed for fast navigation and a smooth user experience.
